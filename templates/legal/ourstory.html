            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                At eKhoji Nepal, we believe in the power of local commerce. Our journey began with a simple vision: to create a platform where Nepali businesses and customers could connect effortlessly within their own communities.

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">How It All Started</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                In a rapidly digitalizing world, we noticed a gap in the market. While global e-commerce giants were expanding their reach, local businesses in Nepal were struggling to establish their digital presence. Many small business owners with exceptional products and services lacked the resources and technical knowledge to bring their offerings online.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
                That's when the idea of eKhoji was born—a platform specifically designed to empower local sellers and provide customers with easy access to products and services in their vicinity.
